# hello-world

Hola peeps!
I'm Michelle and I'm new at programming. I'm still trying to find the one I like best. I have dabbled in HTML (a thousand years ago when we just put everything in tables - so maybe it doesn't even count now!) I started playing with Unity and learning a little C# - then decided that it would be better to do Android Applications for my job so I switched to learning Java - and now it seems I need to learn JS for work. So, all that to say, I've learned a tiny bit about a few languages and not enough to know much of anything yet! Ack!!
